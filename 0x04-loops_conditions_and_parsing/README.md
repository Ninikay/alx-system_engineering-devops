# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers programming in bash using loops conditions and parsing techniques

# Learning Objectives 
At the end of this project, I will learn how to solve these questions:

* How to create SSH keys
* What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
* How to use while, until and for loops
* How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
* How to use the cut command
* What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

# 0x16 API advanced
Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers API management for system adminsitrations.

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* How to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for
* How to use an API with pagination
* How to parse JSON results from an API
* How to make a recursive API call
* How to sort a dictionary by value

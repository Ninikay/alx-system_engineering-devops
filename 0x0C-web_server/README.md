# 0x0C. Web server

Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers automation tasks for web server management at real enviroment scenarios

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* What is the main role of a web server
* What is a child process
* Why web servers usually have a parent process and child processes
* What are the main HTTP requests
* What DNS stands for
* What is DNS main role

## Tasks 

0. Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server
1. Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine with Nginx
2. Bash script configuring Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.
3. Bash script configuring Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.
